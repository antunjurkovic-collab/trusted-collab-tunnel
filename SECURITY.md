# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.9.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.9   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Access Control

**API Key Mode:**
- When `tct_auth_mode` is set to `api_key`, ensure API keys are:
  - Strong (minimum 32 characters, cryptographically random)
  - Stored securely in WordPress options (not in version control)
  - Rotated regularly (recommend every 90 days)
  - Transmitted only over HTTPS

**Public Mode:**
- Default mode (`tct_auth_mode = off`) allows unrestricted access to machine endpoints
- This is intended behavior for public content
- Do not use public mode for sensitive, paywalled, or embargoed content

### HMAC Key Handling

**Usage Receipt Keys:**
- `tct_receipt_hmac_key` should be:
  - Generated using cryptographically secure random source
  - Minimum 32 bytes (256 bits)
  - Never committed to version control
  - Never logged or exposed in error messages
  - Rotated if compromised

**Key Storage:**
- Keys are stored in WordPress wp_options table
- Recommend additional encryption at rest (server-level)
- Consider using WordPress Secrets or environment variables for production

### Header Injection Risks

**Input Validation:**
- All URL parameters are sanitized using `esc_url_raw()`
- Link header values are validated before output
- Policy URLs (`tct_terms_url`, `tct_pricing_url`) should be absolute URLs only

**Mitigation:**
- Plugin validates all header values
- No user-supplied data directly inserted into headers
- Canonical URLs derived from WordPress post objects

### PII and Privacy Considerations

**Machine-Readable JSON:**
- May contain personally identifiable information (PII) if present in post content
- Review content before enabling TCT on posts containing:
  - Personal names, addresses, email addresses
  - User-generated content with PII
  - Comments or author information

**Recommendations:**
- Use `tct_build_payload` filter to redact PII from JSON output
- Exclude sensitive post types from TCT endpoints
- Review privacy policy implications

**Example PII Redaction:**
```php
add_filter('tct_build_payload', function($ret, $post, $c_url, $m_url) {
    if (!empty($ret['payload']['author'])) {
        $ret['payload']['author'] = 'Author Name Redacted';
    }
    return $ret;
}, 10, 4);
```

### Usage Receipt Data Minimization

**Receipt Contents:**
- Receipts include: contract ID, HTTP status, bytes transferred, ETag, timestamp
- HMAC signature proves authenticity
- Do not log or transmit receipts unless required for billing/analytics

**Best Practices:**
- Enable receipts only when needed (`tct_receipts_enabled = 0` by default)
- Receipts should be consumed by client, not stored long-term
- HMAC verification prevents tampering but receipts contain metadata

### Cache Poisoning

**ETag Stability:**
- ETags are derived from normalized content only
- Template, CSS, JavaScript changes do NOT affect ETag
- This is intentional (template-invariant fingerprinting)

**Risk:**
- Malicious modifications to content will change ETag and trigger re-fetch
- Standard WordPress content security applies

**Mitigation:**
- Use WordPress roles and capabilities to control post editing
- Monitor content changes via WordPress audit logs
- ETags use SHA-256 (collision-resistant)

### Vary Header and Content Negotiation

**Current Implementation:**
- `Vary: Accept` header is set on machine endpoints
- Content is JSON (fixed format), not negotiated

**Consideration:**
- If future versions support multiple formats, ensure proper Vary handling
- Intermediary caches must respect Vary header

### HEAD Request Handling

**Availability:**
- HEAD requests may not be supported by all server configurations
- Plugin handles HEAD requests identically to GET (returns headers, no body)

**Fallback:**
- Clients should gracefully fall back to GET with `If-None-Match` if HEAD fails
- Both methods return same ETag and support 304 Not Modified

### WordPress Security Best Practices

**General:**
- Keep WordPress core, plugins, and themes updated
- Use strong passwords and 2FA for admin accounts
- Run WordPress on HTTPS only
- Configure proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)

**Specific to TCT:**
- Restrict access to `Settings â†’ TCT Settings` to administrators only
- Review generated JSON output before enabling in production
- Test with a staging site first

### Logging and Monitoring

**What to Monitor:**
- Unusual spikes in `/llm-sitemap.json` requests (potential abuse)
- High 304 Not Modified rates (expected, good)
- Low 304 rates with unchanged content (potential cache bypass)
- Unexpected API key authentication failures

**What NOT to Log:**
- API keys (even hashed values)
- HMAC secrets
- Full receipt data (contains metadata)

### Server Configuration Notes

**WAF and Cloudflare:**
- Allowlist `/llm-sitemap.json` and `/{canonical}/llm/` paths
- Do not block based on User-Agent (legitimate crawlers vary)
- Allow HEAD method (some WAFs block by default)

**LiteSpeed Cache:**
- Exclude `/llm-sitemap.json` from caching (dynamic, changes frequently)
- Exclude `/{canonical}/llm/` endpoints if using `tct_receipts_enabled`
- Allow ETags to pass through (do not strip)

**robots.txt:**
- Do NOT block `/llm*` paths if you want crawlers to discover endpoints
- Example:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /llm-sitemap.json
Allow: /*/llm/
```
